## Datasets

1. **Schema**
The schema is provided as a JSON file that defines the structure of the Kusto database. 
2. **Semantic Data Catalog**
The semantic data catalog is provided as a YAML file, enriched with annotations to facilitate natural language understanding.
3. **Evaluation Datasets**
The evaluation datasets contain NLQ-KQL pairs that were drafted by domain experts for two distinct Kusto databases, each with unique schemas:
- **Sentinel**: [microsoft-sentinel](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/microsoft-sentinel)
- **Defender**: [microsoft-defender](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-defender)


## Safe and responsible use 
This research project leverages advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide sophisticated natural language processing capabilities to generate KQL queries. As powerful as these tools are, it is crucial to use them in a manner that is both safe and responsible. The method is intended to use the GPT-4 model from OpenAI, either via the OpenAI or Azure OpenAI APIs. See the [GPT-4 System Card](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4-system-card.pdf) to understand the capabilities and limitations of this model. 

## Disclaimer
The purpose of this research project is solely focused on translating natural language queries into Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries. The data released here is intended strictly for research purposes related to the text-to-KQL task and is not authorized for any other use.
